0.  BMP upto 32bpp = 4,294,967,296 possible colours
    GIF upto 256 colors in a single frame
    PNG upto 64bpp = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (2^64) possible colours
    JPEG upto 24bpp = 16,777,216 possible colours.
    
1.  The GIF file format supports animation.

2.  Lossy compression is when information or data is lost when compression is applied. 
    Lossless compression happens without any data or information loss.
    
3.  The JPEG format is a lossy compression format.

4.  When a file is "deleted" on a FAT file system, its entry in the allocation table 
    is marked as "erased", and its clusters are moved into the hard drives list 
    of available clusters.
    
5.  An everyday person, to ensure actual erasure of data on their hard drive could: 
        - physically destroy the drive, rendering it completely unusable
        - overwrite the old data with new data
        - degauss the drive ( decreasing or eliminating a remnant magnetic field 'wikipedia.org/wiki/Degaussing' ).

6.  stdint.h is a header file defining new integer type standards.

7.  To ensure uniformity in size across different compilation and execution environments, enabling portability.

8.  BYTE = 1 byte
    WORD = 2 bytes
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    
9.  First 2 bytes of a .bmp file must be: BM (ascii), 42 4d (hex), 66 77 (dec).

10. bfSize is the size of the bitmap file.
    biSize is the size of the bitmap info header (BITMAPINFOHEADER).

11. If beHeight is a negative number, it means the DIB is stored top-down, meaning 
    the top left pixel of the image, is stored at the start of the file.
    
12. biBitCount is the member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure that determin00000000000000000000000000es the number of bits per pixel.

13. fopen may return null if an error occurs while trying to perform the requested operation.

14. The third argument to fread is always 1, because we are reading each pixel struct one at a time.

15. 3.

16. fseek sets the file position indictator in a given stream.

17. SEEK_CUR is a constant value that can be passed as an argument to fseek to indicate that the given offset is 
    relative to the current indicator position.

18. Milo Banana dun it!
